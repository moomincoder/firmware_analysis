### This repo is a collection of scripts I've written to assist with quickly analyzing firmware that I've dumped from IoT devices (mainly security cameras)\
#### ToDo:
- Script to automate firmware extraction a little more
- Have hash_yoinker.sh check hashes against crackstation or something like that, if they don't have a hit, save them until everything else is done, and then try and crack them
- Script to look for interesting file types and make a list/copy them to seperate folder
- Any other good ideas

I am hoping to add more scripts, options, and to just make things easier for myself, if you want to contribute please do, but be aware, I'm trying to keep this all in bash.
